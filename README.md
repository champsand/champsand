# 👋 Hey there, I’m Matthew

🌱 A Computer Science student who loves learning by *building* — whether it’s AI logic, database systems, or something that just makes life a little smoother.  
🧭 Currently exploring: **AI fundamentals**, **MySQL**, **Intelligent Systems**, and how data + logic can work together smartly.  
📍 Based in Indonesia

## 🧠 About Me
I learn best by breaking things apart and figuring out how each one of them **works**.
I’m that person who likes to walk a lot, think in quiet places, and then come back with a clear idea for the next small **project**.
  
💬 Topics I enjoy talking about:  
AI | Technology | Smart Devices | Tech that helps people | Self-growth | Systems Thinking | Human Psychology

✨ *“Code is just structured curiosity.”*  
I’m here to keep learning — one repo, one quiet walk, and one idea at a time.
